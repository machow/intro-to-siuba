# Wrap up


```{python setup, include=FALSE, tags=c("input-details", "setup")}
# TODO: explain how to run this, and that they only need the gist (loads tools)

import pandas as pd
from siuba import arrange, select, mutate, filter, _
from plotnine import ggplot, geom_point, coord_flip, aes, labs

# temporary until I figure out where to put data
url = "https://siublocks.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/music_top200.csv"
music_top200 = pd.read_csv(url)


# TODO: shift into a package or file
from siuba import pipe
from IPython.display import HTML, display
___ = pipe(lambda x: display(HTML("⚠️: <b>Don't forget to replace all the blanks!<b>")) and _)

pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 6)

from IPython import get_ipython
# special ipython function to get the html formatter
html_formatter = get_ipython().display_formatter.formatters['text/html']

# when you see a Shout object, call the shout_html function on it
html_formatter.for_type(pd.DataFrame, lambda df: df.to_html(max_rows = pd.get_option("display.max_rows")))
```

## Putting it together

TODO: explain


```{python}
(music_top200 
  >> filter(_.position == 1)
  >> select(_.country, _.energy, _.acousticness) 
  >> ggplot(aes("energy", "acousticness")) + geom_point()
)
```


```{python}
# TODO: don't include hours, introduce a lot of baggage
#hours = 3600*1000 

(music_top200
  >> filter(_.country == "Hong Kong")
  >> mutate(stream_ms = _.streams * _.duration_ms)
#  >> mutate(stream_hours = (_.streams * _.duration_ms) / hours)
  >> select(_.stream_ms, _.position, _.acousticness, _.energy)
  >> ggplot(aes("stream_ms", "position")) + geom_point()
)
```


## Exercises

* What is Argentina's 10th most popular song? What's their most danceable song?
  (future note: we can't filter eg 10th most danceable yet)
* TODO: add more


Advanced

* Notice how we could filter songs in the 5th most streamed position, but not the 5th most danceable. (Show row_number called directly on Series, invite to put into mutate)
