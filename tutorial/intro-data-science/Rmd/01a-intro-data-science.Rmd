# Introduction to Data Analysis with Siuba: Basics


```{python setup, tags=c("input-details", "setup")}
# TODO: explain how to run this, and that they only need the gist (loads tools)
import pandas as pd
from siuba import arrange, select, mutate, filter, _
from plotnine import ggplot, geom_point, coord_flip, aes, labs

# temporary until I figure out where to put data
fname = "https://siublocks.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/course-data/music200.csv"
music_top200 = pd.read_csv(fname)

# tracks
fname = "https://siublocks.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/course-data/track_features.csv"
track_features = pd.read_csv(fname)


# TODO: shift into a package or file
from siuba import pipe
from IPython.display import HTML, display
___ = pipe(lambda x: display(HTML("‚ö†Ô∏è: <b>Don't forget to replace all the blanks!<b>")) and _)

pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 6)

from IPython import get_ipython
# special ipython function to get the html formatter
html_formatter = get_ipython().display_formatter.formatters['text/html']

# when you see a Shout object, call the shout_html function on it
html_formatter.for_type(pd.DataFrame, lambda df: df.to_html(classes = "dataframe", max_rows = pd.get_option("display.max_rows")))

    * Blinding lights was streamed 7744570 times.
    * 10 rows are being shown from the DataFrame
    * The track named Myron has a speechiness of 0.29

## What you'll learn to do

In this tutorial you will learn about..

* data that is represented in table called a DataFrame.
* how to arrange rows and select columns.
* how to create new columns and cut out specific rows.

The next two examples show what you'll be able to do by the end of this chapter.
It's okay if the code doesn't make sense yet.
Just being able to run someone else's code goes a long way!



### Big example 1: finding high energy hits

Run the code below. It should do the following:

* **arrange** the rows--first by position (lowest first), and second by energy (highest first).
* **select** specific columns, such as country, position, and artist.

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> arrange(_.position, _.duration)
  >> select(_.country, _.position, _.artist, _.track_name, _.duration)
)
```

Try doing the actions below, and then running the code.

> üî® Try changing the two uses of `_.energy` above to `_.danciness`.


### Big example 2: which countries does an artist have hits in?

Run the code below. It should do the following:

* **filter** to keep rows for the artist ITZY
* use **ggplot** to add a point for each row in the filtered data.

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist == "ITZY")
  >> ggplot(aes("streams", "country")) + geom_point() + labs(title = "ITZY hits across countries")
)
```


> üî® Try changing the term `"ITZY"` to `"TIX"`. How many countries have TIX hits?

> üî® Try stopping the plot with a comment. That is, put `#` to the left of `>> ggplot`. This should show you the raw data.

<details>
    <summary>solution</summary>

Here is the solution code...
    
```python
# code with artist changed, and plot commented out
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist == "TIX")
  #>> ggplot(aes("streams", "country")) + geom_point() + labs(title = "ITZY hits across countries")
)
```

</details>
