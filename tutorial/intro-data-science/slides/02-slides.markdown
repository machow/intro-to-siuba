# Visualization with plotnine

<aside class="notes">


In the last chapter, you used the dplyr package to answer some questions about the gapminder dataset.

You've been able to..

* filter for particular observations.
* arrange to find the highest or lowest values.
* mutate to add new columns.

However, most of the code so far has only printed out results as a table.
Often a better way to understand and present this kind of data is as a graph.

In this chapter, you'll learn the essential skill of data visualization using the plotnine package.

In particular, this chapter will show you how to create scatterplots, like the one you see here.

Scatterplots compare two variables on an x- and y- axis.

Visualization and data wrangling are often intertwined, so you'll see how
the siuba and plotnine packages work closely together to create informative graphs.

# Importing plotnine


<pre><code class="language-python">
from siuba import *
from plotnine import *
</code></pre>

<aside class="notes">


You'll be creating plots using the plotnine package.

Just like the siuba package, you'll have to load it with `import`.

# Variables

```python
billie = (
  track_features
  >> filter(_.artist == "Billie Eilish")
)
```
<aside class="notes">


In this chapter, you'll sometimes be visualizing subsets of the `track_features` data.
For example, this code gets only tracks by the artist Billie Eilish.

When you're working with just that subset, sometimes it's useful to save the filtered data, as a new data frame.

To do this, you use the assignment operator.

</aside></section><section class="">

# Variables


```python
(
  track_features
  >> filter(_.artist == "Billie Eilish")
)
```
<aside class="notes">


First, write out the pipe with the filter verb.

This is the same as you did in the previous chapter.

Note that whether the name of the data, `track_features` is right after the `(` or on its own line, the code works the same.

</aside></section><section class="">

# Variables


<pre><code class="language-python">
<mark>billie = </mark>(
  track_features
  >> filter(_.artist == "Billie Eilish")
)
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">


Then, write the variable name, followed by the variable operator (an equal sign).

In this case, the variable name is `billie`.

Now if you print the `billie` dataset, we can see that it's another table.

But this one has only 27 rows: one for each track by Billie Eilish in the original data.

# Visualizing with plotnine

```python
(billie
 >> ggplot(aes("energy", "valence"))
  + geom_point()
  + labs(title = "Billie Eilish hit track features")
)
```

    <ggplot: (-9223372036558685717)>


<aside class="notes">


Suppose you want to examine the energy and valence of Billie Eilish's songs.

You could do this with a scatterplot comparing two variables in our
track_features dataset: energy on the x-axis and valence on the y-axis.

There are three parts to a plotnine graph.

**(Click the down button to see a breakdown of the code)**

</aside></section><section class="font-size-sm">

# Visualizing with plotnine


<pre><code class="language-python">(<mark>billie</mark>
 >> ggplot(aes("energy", "valence"))
  + geom_point()
  + labs(title = "Billie Eilish hit track features")  
)
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">


First is the data that we're visualizing.
In this case, that is the `billie` variable you just created.

</aside></section><section class="font-size-sm">

# Visualizing with plotnine


<pre><code class="language-python">(billie
 >> ggplot(<mark>aes("energy", "valence")</mark>)
  + geom_point()
  + labs(title = "Billie Eilish hit track features")
)
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">


Second is the mapping of variables in your dataset to aesthetics in your graph.

An aesthetic is a visual dimension of a graph that can be used to communicate information.

In a scatterplot, your two dimensions are the x axis and the y axis, so you write aes (for
"aesthetic"), parentheses, x equals gdpPerCap, y = lifeExp, telling it which variables to place on which axes.


</aside></section><section class="font-size-sm">

# Visualizing with plotnine


<pre><code class="language-python">(billie
 >> ggplot(aes("energy", "valence"))
  <mark>+ geom_point()</mark>
  + labs(title = "Billie Eilish hit track features")
)
</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">


The third step is specifying the type of graph you're creating.
You do that by adding a layer to the graph: use a plus after the ggplot, and then geom underscore point.

The "geom" means you're adding a type of geometric object to the graph, the
"point" indicates it's a scatter plot, where each observation corresponds to one point.

Together, these three parts of the code--the data, the
aesthetic mapping, and the layer--construct the scatter plot you see here.
