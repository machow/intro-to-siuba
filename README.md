## Content

* [Rmd folder with lesson content](tutorial/intro-data-science/Rmd)
* [slides folder](tutorial/intro-data-science/slides)

## How to Make Updates

This course is automatically staged and deployed using github actions.

* [Staging site](http://staging-learn.siuba.org/): updated when a change is made on the master or staging branches.
* [Production site](http://learn.siuba.org/): updated when a release is made.

### Deploying

1. Commit your changes to master or staging.
2. Once the github action runs, look for the entry called `üê£: Check content diff`, showing which files changed after content rebuild.
3. For changed files, look on http://staging-learn.siuba.org/ to see that the changes make sense.
4. Create a release, which will trigger a rebuild and deployment!

## Roadmap

### Before release

* Formatting cleanup
  - Exercise headings
  - Clearly marking the slides
  - Some typos / markdown getting mangled
  - Few places where details element is used instead of a question box
  - Better slide transitions when user clicks down (i.e. appears immediately)
* Run some people through chapters 2 and 3
* Intro page? (could punt to down the road)
* A couple of screencasts showing 10 minute analyses, using skills from course
  (could also use verbs like count(), and refer to docs).
* Suggested Tidy Tuesdays to try
* A "next steps" outro lesson (could put at end of chapter 3 for now)
* Figure out and add license
* Remove /build/ from lesson urls


### Down the road

* Record video for slides
* Clicking up key terms brings up definitions
* A big cheatsheet showing everything taught
* Chapter 4
  - first 2 lessons on plots, then 1 on bridge material (e.g. simple pandas read_csv)?
